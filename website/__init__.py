    #app.config: This is a dictionary that stores configuration variables for your Flask app.
    #The "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI" key specifically holds the connection string for SQLAlchemy to know which database to use.
    #sqlite:///: This part tells SQLAlchemy to use SQLite as the database.
    #{DB_NAME}: This is a placeholder for the actual database file name.
    db.init_app(app)  #The purpose of db.init_app(app) is to connect the db object (which represents the database) to your Flask app. When you create the db object using SQLAlchemy(), itâ€™s not linked to any specific app yet. By calling db.init_app(app), you are telling the db object to use the settings and context of your Flask app, such as where the database is located. This step is essential to make sure your app can interact with the database, perform queries, and manage data properly.
